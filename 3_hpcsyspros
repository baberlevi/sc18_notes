## Keynote (Bill Anderson - NCAR, storage engr):
### Best practices for managing 10's of TBs of data 
* ncar has > 100tb
* 38P scratch (short), 22P arch disk (med), 100P tape (long)
* centralized storage (instead of silod per pipeline step) has worked out well
* 'campaign' storage (between scratch & archive) i.e. drives not tape  
* mdtest, IOR for benchmarks
* run benchmarks before/after updates
* t10-pi (standard for data integrity)
* be careful w/ firmware upgrades
* looking into tools like starfish for metadata tracking
* don't backup, don't help users move data, no common tool/method to migrate data
* implemented enforced quotas on archive for first time this yr in 30 yrs
