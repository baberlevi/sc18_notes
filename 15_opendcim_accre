# opendcim (Warren Eckstein)

## some facility background
* lstore (in house developed storage), about 10PB
* hardware keeps sprawling
* just a handful of people
* (we should contact Scott Milliken to put us on the users list)
* vanderbilt UIT uses a 'plugin' for opendcim that tracks card check in/out for the facility
* active mailing list & irc, in addition to wiki & videos
* can use snmp to do some imports, or build import with spreadsheets
* there is an inventory 'checkoff' for a rack
* they give the finance person access and let them look up assets as needed
* some templates are open source, if you've used all of your own images you can share with the group (cautious about not using vendor pics, etc.)
* can set the tmeplate as a chassis, and list the individual blades
* restful api, returns standard json
* they built a dcim cli
* have to be diligent about putting in new equip
* two primary devs: scott & oakrigde, other at vanderbilt
