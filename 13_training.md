# Innovative Approaches for Developing Acccessible, Productive, Scalable HPC training

## ORNL
* when they got GPUs, held GPU hackathons
* users bring app, spend 5 days with two mentors with a really good start on getting ported to summit
* 180 codes have gotten some accel
* https://www.olcf.ornl.giuv/gpu-hackathons
* started by Fernande Foerter when at OCLF (now at nvidia)

## Appentra
* Also doing hackathons
* Find that many don't know how the code works well enough to effectively parallelize it

## EPCC (Weronika Filinger)
* supercomputing mooc
* 5 weeks of content, divided into sections
* have run 4 times in 2 years
* have had 5K learners
* wide range of backgrounds & age ranges
* really dependent on engagement with other students & instructor

## Sandia (Elaine Raybourn)
* Focus on games, being embedded in a culture
* Time is a big challenge with adult learners, need best practices to be effective

## LBNL (Osni Marques)
* http://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars
* Also working with Rebecca Harman-Baker
* Trying to promote methods to help w/ constant refactoring for new archs
* Accept contributions from volunteers
* webinars
* lots of good topics (python, ggit, roofline, BSSw, Popper, CMake, etc.)
* 26-127 attendees , which is ~50% of registrations
* open to non-doe attendees
* challenge: how to gauge effectiveness

## Questions:

### How to handle different skill levels?
* group peers by general scientific application (i.e. finite element, sparse matrix)
* pair up those strong w/ the science background with others with strong programming
* ask for 'applications' to hackathon so you get some background & can pre-pair
* check on NVIDIA training opportunities
* audience mentions: hpc carpentry, ask.ci, better scientific software

## panel question, most ignored user community?
* sysadmins
* noobs
* everyone
